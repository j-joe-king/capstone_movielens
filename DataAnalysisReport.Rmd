## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to provide a machine learning model for a movie recommendation system.  The data on which this model is produced is the Movielens 10M available from [GroupLens research lab](https://grouplens.org/)

The Movielens 10M dataset comprises around 10 million ratings categorised by user and movie. Approximately 10% of the data is reservered as a validation set, with the remainder being used to train the model.

The metric for measuring the quality of the model produced is the root mean square error ($\textbf {RMSE}$) represented by the equation

> $\textbf {RMSE} = \sqrt{(\frac {1}{\textbf N})\sum_{u,i}(\hat y_{u,i}-y_{u,i})^2}$

where $y_{u,i}$ is the rating for movie i by user u, $\hat y_{u,i}$ is the corresponding prediction produced by the model, and N is is the number of user/movie combinations in the validation dataset.

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
